Hi! I need help completing my Week 10 in-class assignment titled "WORKSHEET" The task asks me to complete Steps 1, 2, and 3 (no code) for two problems: 1. Tip Calculator 2. Late Fee Calculator I need to explain the problem in my own words, identify the inputs and outputs, and work through each example by hand using given numbers. Then I need to format everything into a Google Colab notebook using markdown only (no code), and submit it with an AI conversation log. Can you help me: - Understand and explain each problem clearly? - Identify correct inputs and outputs for both? - Manually calculate the examples (as shown in the worksheet)? - Format the answers in markdown so I can copy them into Google Colab? - Generate an AI conversation log for submission? Thanks!
