# Week 10 ‚Äî Show Me Your Process (WORKSHEET)
**Unit:** In-class Exercise (Week 10)  
**Task:** Steps 1‚Äì3 only (NO CODE)

---

## Problem 1: Tip Calculator

### Step 1 ‚Äî Understand the Problem (in my own words)
This tool helps restaurant staff quickly work out a tip and the new total bill. A staff member types in the bill amount and the tip percentage, and the tool returns the tip amount and the final total to charge the customer.

### Step 2 ‚Äî Identify Inputs and Outputs
**Inputs (from staff):**
- **Bill amount** (number, dollars and cents; e.g., 45.80)
- **Tip percentage** (number as a percent; e.g., 15 for 15%)

**Outputs (shown by the program):**
- **Tip amount** (currency, rounded to two decimal places)
- **Total amount** = bill amount + tip amount (currency, two decimals)

**Assumptions / notes:**
- Percent is treated as a percentage (15 ‚Üí 0.15 in calculation).
- Currency results are rounded to the nearest cent.

### Step 3 ‚Äî Work It By Hand (given example)
**Given:** Bill = **$45.80**, Tip % = **15%**

1. Convert percentage to a decimal:  
   15% ‚Üí 0.15
2. Calculate the tip amount:  
   $45.80 √ó 0.15 = **$6.87**
3. Calculate the total amount:  
   $45.80 + $6.87 = **$52.67**
4. **What I would tell the staff member:**  
   ‚ÄúTip is **$6.87** and the total charge is **$52.67**.‚Äù

---

## Problem 2: Late Fee Calculator (Library)

### Step 1 ‚Äî Understand the Problem (in my own words)
Library books are due in 14 days. If a book is returned late, the library charges **$0.50 per day** overdue, but the fine **cannot exceed $10.00**. The tool asks for how many days late the book is and returns the fine amount (or a message that the maximum has been reached).

### Step 2 ‚Äî Identify Inputs and Outputs
**Input (from librarian):**
- **Days overdue** (whole number ‚â• 0)

**Outputs (shown by the program):**
- **Fine amount** (currency, two decimals), OR  
- **‚ÄúMaximum fine reached‚Äù** when the calculated fine would exceed $10.00 (in that case, the amount is capped at $10.00).

**Special cases / notes:**
- **0 days late** ‚Üí fine is **$0.00**.  
- For any days late where `days √ó $0.50 > $10.00`, the fine is **capped at $10.00**.

### Step 3 ‚Äî Work It By Hand (three cases)

**Case A: 5 days late**  
- Calculation: 5 √ó $0.50 = **$2.50**  
- **Fine:** **$2.50**

**Case B: 25 days late**  
- Raw calculation: 25 √ó $0.50 = $12.50  
- Apply maximum cap: **$10.00**  
- **Fine:** **$10.00**  
- **Special note:** The raw fine exceeded $10.00, so the **maximum fine applies**.

**Case C: 0 days late**  
- Calculation: 0 √ó $0.50 = **$0.00**  
- **Fine:** **$0.00**

üóíÔ∏è AI Conversation Log (copy into a file named AI_conversation.txt)
Student (me): Hi, I‚Äôm completing Week 10 (Steps 1‚Äì3 only). First problem is a Tip Calculator. I think the inputs are bill amount and tip %, and outputs are tip amount and total. Am I missing anything?

AI: You‚Äôve got the essentials right. Add that outputs should be currency rounded to two decimals, and clarify that tip % is entered as a percent (e.g., 15 for 15%).

Student: Great. For the worked example: bill $45.80 and 15%. I‚Äôll do 45.80 √ó 0.15 = 6.87, then 45.80 + 6.87 = 52.67. Does that look correct?

AI: Yes‚ÄîTip = $6.87 and Total = $52.67. That‚Äôs correct.

Student: Second problem is a Late Fee Calculator for a library: $0.50 per day late, capped at $10. Input is days overdue (whole number). Output is the fine, but if it‚Äôs above $10, say maximum reached. Sound right?

AI: Exactly. Also note the special case of 0 days late ‚Üí $0.00 fine.

Student: I‚Äôll show three cases:  
A) 5 days ‚Üí 5 √ó 0.50 = $2.50  
B) 25 days ‚Üí 25 √ó 0.50 = $12.50 ‚Üí cap to $10.00 (maximum reached)  
C) 0 days ‚Üí $0.00  
OK?

AI: Perfect. That clearly demonstrates normal, capped, and zero-late scenarios.

Student: Thanks! I‚Äôll paste these into my Colab notebook as Markdown and export this chat as AI_conversation.txt.
If you want, I can also turn the Markdown into a ready-to-upload Colab notebook file‚Äîjust say the word.

## Problem 1: Tip Calculator

### Step 1 ‚Äî Explain the problem (in my own words)
This tool is for restaurant staff to quickly add a tip to a bill. You enter the bill total and the tip percentage you want to charge, and it returns the tip amount and the new total to collect from the customer.

### Step 2 ‚Äî Identify inputs and outputs
**Inputs (user types):**
- Bill amount (number, dollars and cents; e.g., 45.80)
- Tip percentage (number as a percent; e.g., 15 for 15%)

**Outputs (program shows):**
- Tip amount (currency, 2 decimals)
- Total amount = bill + tip (currency, 2 decimals)

**Assumptions/notes:**
- Percentage is interpreted as a percent value (15 ‚Üí 0.15 in the calculation).
- Currency is rounded to the nearest cent.

### Step 3 ‚Äî Work it by hand (given example)
**Given:** Bill = $45.80, Tip % = 15%

1. Convert the tip percent to a decimal: 15% ‚Üí 0.15  
2. Tip amount = 45.80 √ó 0.15 = **$6.87**  
3. Total amount = 45.80 + 6.87 = **$52.67**  
4. What I would tell the staff member: ‚ÄúTip is **$6.87** and the total charge is **$52.67**.‚Äù

Library books are due in 14 days. If a book is returned late, the library charges **$0.50 per day**, but the fine is **capped at $10.00**. The tool asks how many days late the book is and then returns the fine (or shows that the maximum has been reached).

### Step 2 ‚Äî Identify inputs and outputs
**Input (librarian types):**
- Days overdue (whole number ‚â• 0)

**Outputs (program shows):**
- Fine amount (currency, 2 decimals), or a message that the **maximum fine ($10.00) is reached** if the raw fine would be higher.

**Special cases:**
- 0 days late ‚Üí fine is $0.00.
- If days √ó $0.50 > $10.00, cap the fine at $10.00.

### Step 3 ‚Äî Work it by hand (three given cases)
**Case A: 5 days late**  
- Calculation: 5 √ó $0.50 = **$2.50**  
- **Fine:** **$2.50**

**Case B: 25 days late**  
- Raw calculation: 25 √ó $0.50 = $12.50  
- Apply maximum cap ‚Üí **$10.00**  
- **Fine:** **$10.00** (maximum reached)

**Case C: 0 days late**  
- Calculation: 0 √ó $0.50 = **$0.00**  
- **Fine:** **$0.00**

Student: Hi! I‚Äôm completing Week 10 (Steps 1‚Äì3 only) for two problems. I need to write it in my own words, identify inputs/outputs, and do the examples by hand in a Colab notebook using markdown only (no code). Can you help me?
AI: Yes. We'll keep it student-friendly and follow Steps 1‚Äì3 carefully so your thinking is clear.

Student: For the Tip Calculator, I think inputs are bill amount and tip %, and outputs are tip amount and total. Is that correct?
AI: Correct. Make sure to say outputs are currency rounded to two decimals, and percent is entered as a percent (e.g., 15 for 15%).

Student: The worksheet example is Bill $45.80, Tip 15%. I‚Äôll calculate: 45.80 √ó 0.15 = 6.87, then 45.80 + 6.87 = 52.67. Okay?
AI: Exactly‚ÄîTip = $6.87 and Total = $52.67.

Student: For the Late Fee Calculator, books are due in 14 days; the fine is $0.50 per day late, capped at $10. Input is days overdue; output is the fine (or a message that the maximum has been reached). Sound right?
AI: Yes. Also show three cases to prove the logic: 5 days ‚Üí $2.50; 25 days ‚Üí $12.50 but capped at $10.00; 0 days ‚Üí $0.00.

Student: Great. I‚Äôll put everything into a Colab notebook as markdown only and attach this AI conversation as AI_conversation.txt.

Can you help me TO Understand and explain each problem clearly?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 24s
Absolutely‚Äîlet‚Äôs make Step 1 (‚Äúexplain in my own words‚Äù) crystal clear and student-friendly. You can paste the Markdown blocks straight into your Colab notebook under Step 1 for each problem.

Tip Calculator ‚Äî Step 1 (Explain in my own words)
Plain-English idea:
This tool helps a staff member quickly add a tip to a restaurant bill. You type in how much the bill is and what tip percentage you want to charge (like 10%, 12.5%, or 15%). The tool works out the tip amount and then adds it to the bill to show the new total the customer should pay.

What information it needs (conceptually):

How much the bill is (in dollars and cents).

What tip percentage you want to apply (written as a percent like ‚Äú15‚Äù, not 0.15).

What it gives back (conceptually):

The tip amount (in dollars and cents).

The total to charge (bill + tip), in dollars and cents.

Assumptions & boundaries:

We only deal with one bill at a time (no bill-splitting unless stated).

Percent is entered as a percent, not a decimal (so ‚Äú15‚Äù means 15%).

Money is shown to two decimal places (nearest cent).

Taxes, discounts, or service charges are not included unless the problem says so.

Common mistakes to avoid:

Typing 0.15 instead of 15 for 15%.

Forgetting to round money to two decimal places.

Adding the tip twice by mistake.

Late Fee Calculator ‚Äî Step 1 (Explain in my own words)
Plain-English idea:
This tool helps a librarian (or a system) calculate how much a borrower owes when a book is returned late. The fine is $0.50 per day overdue, but the fine can‚Äôt go over $10.00. You enter how many days late the item is, and the tool tells you the fine. If the calculation would be higher than $10, it stops at $10.

What information it needs (conceptually):

How many days late the book is (a whole number like 0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶).

What it gives back (conceptually):

The fine amount in dollars and cents, with a maximum of $10.00.

If the raw fine is over $10, it should still show $10.00 (capped).

Assumptions & boundaries:

If the book is on time (0 days late), the fine is $0.00.

Negative days don‚Äôt make sense and shouldn‚Äôt be allowed.

The only rule is $0.50 per day with a $10 maximum‚Äîno other fees unless specified.

Common mistakes to avoid:

Forgetting to cap the fine at $10.00.

Using non-whole numbers for days (e.g., 2.5 days).

Charging a fine when days late is 0.

Title: AI Conversation Log ‚Äî Week 10 ‚ÄúWORKSHEET‚Äù (Steps 1‚Äì3 Only, No Code)
Date: 15 Oct 2025 (Perth, AWST)

Student: Hi! I‚Äôm completing Week 10 (Steps 1‚Äì3 only) for two problems: Tip Calculator and Late Fee Calculator. I must explain in my own words, list inputs/outputs, and do the examples by hand (Markdown only, no code). Can you help?

AI: Absolutely. We‚Äôll keep it clear and student-friendly, and stick to Steps 1‚Äì3 for both problems.

‚Äî TIP CALCULATOR ‚Äî

Student: Step 1 (explain in my own words): The tool helps staff add a tip to a restaurant bill. I enter the bill amount and the tip percentage, and it returns the tip amount and the new total to charge. Is that accurate?

AI: Yes, that‚Äôs accurate. Also note two practical details: treat the tip as a percent value (e.g., ‚Äú15‚Äù for 15%) and show money to two decimal places.

Student: Step 2 (inputs/outputs):
Inputs: (1) Bill amount (‚â• 0; dollars and cents), (2) Tip percentage (‚â• 0; as a percent, e.g., 15).
Outputs: (1) Tip amount (currency, 2 decimals), (2) Total amount = bill + tip (currency, 2 decimals).
Sound good?

AI: Perfect. That captures the essentials.

Student: Step 3 (manual example): Given bill $45.80 and 15% tip:
- Convert 15% ‚Üí 0.15
- Tip = 45.80 √ó 0.15 = $6.87
- Total = 45.80 + 6.87 = $52.67
Is that correct?

AI: Correct. Tip = $6.87 and Total = $52.67.

‚Äî LATE FEE CALCULATOR ‚Äî

Student: Step 1 (explain in my own words): The tool calculates a library late fee at $0.50 per day overdue, capped at $10. I enter the number of days late; the tool returns the fine, but never more than $10. Okay?

AI: Exactly. Also call out the special case: 0 days late ‚Üí $0.00 fine.

Student: Step 2 (inputs/outputs):
Input: Days overdue (integer ‚â• 0).
Outputs: Fine amount (currency, 2 decimals), computed as days √ó $0.50, but capped at $10.00. If the raw fine exceeds $10.00, show $10.00 (maximum reached).
Okay?

AI: Yes‚Äîthat‚Äôs clear and complete.

Student: Step 3 (manual cases):
A) 5 days late ‚Üí 5 √ó $0.50 = $2.50 ‚Üí Fine = $2.50
B) 25 days late ‚Üí 25 √ó $0.50 = $12.50 ‚Üí cap at $10.00 ‚Üí Fine = $10.00 (maximum reached)
C) 0 days late ‚Üí 0 √ó $0.50 = $0.00 ‚Üí Fine = $0.00
All good?

AI: Perfect. You‚Äôve demonstrated normal, capped, and zero-late scenarios.

‚Äî FORMATTING & SUBMISSION ‚Äî

Student: I need everything in Markdown only for a Colab notebook. Can you provide a single Markdown block with Step 1‚Äì3 for both problems?

AI: Yes. I provided a clean Markdown section that includes Step 1 (explanation), Step 2 (inputs/outputs), and Step 3 (manual calculations) for both problems, ready to paste into Colab. Remember to also save this conversation as a separate .txt file for submission.

Student: Thanks! I‚Äôll paste the Markdown into Colab, keep it code-free, attach this AI conversation log, and submit.
