My Reflection (Week 8 â€” My Data Story)

- I learned how to open a text file and read lines safely.
- I can show line numbers and count lines, words, and characters.
- Finding the longest, first, and last lines was straightforward.
- This helps in business because many notes/logs are plain text, and a small script can summarise them fast.
- Next, I want to read a CSV and make a simple chart (e.g., runs per over).
