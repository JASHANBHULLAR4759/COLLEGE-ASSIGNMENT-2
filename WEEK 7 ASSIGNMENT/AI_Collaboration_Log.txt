# AI Collaboration Log

**My AI Prompt:**
- "explain this assignment"
- "give me summary for this assignment i want for cricket"
- "i am mediator in python coding, give me code for this assignment and this is in class project and explain me the code"
- "give this code with simple python coding and explain me the code (...)"

**What the AI Helped Me With:**
- Explaining the assignment deliverables and checklist
- Creating a Colab-ready notebook and a sample cricket `my_data.txt`
- Fixing file-not-found in Colab (upload via Files panel, `files.upload()`, or Google Drive mount)
- Writing the program in three styles: full version, simple-loop version, and tiny compact version
- Showing how to print numbered lines and compute: lines, words, total characters, longest line, first/last line
- Suggesting clear commit messages for Git/GitHub
- Generating my AI Log and Reflection files for submission

**What I Learned:**
- How to safely read a file using `with open("my_data.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")`
- How to clean line endings with `rstrip("\n")`
- How to count words with `.split()` and sum them up
- How to find the longest line using `max(lines, key=len)`
- How to show line numbers using `enumerate(lines, 1)`
- How to handle missing files and correct paths in Colab (`/content` vs Drive)
- That simple Python scripts can summarise text quickly for business or study
- How to document AI usage and write short, meaningful commit messages
