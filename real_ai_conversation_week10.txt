Title: REAL AI Conversation — Week 10 “WORKSHEET” (Steps 1–3 Only, No Code)
Date: 15 Oct 2025 (Perth, AWST)

User: Hi! I need help completing my Week 10 in-class assignment titled "WORKSHEET" The task asks me to complete Steps 1, 2, and 3 (no code) for two problems: 1. Tip Calculator 2. Late Fee Calculator

AI: Perfect—let’s knock out Steps 1–3 for both problems (no code) and give you a clean, copy-paste Markdown block for your Google Colab notebook, plus a short AI conversation log you can submit.
[AI provided a full Markdown section for both problems (Steps 1–3) and a sample AI conversation log.]

User: I need to explain the problem in my own words, identify the inputs and outputs, and work through each example by hand using given numbers. Then I need to format everything into a Google Colab notebook using markdown only (no code), and submit it with an AI conversation log.

AI: Awesome—here’s everything you need (Steps 1–3 only, no code), formatted for a Google Colab notebook. I also made a ready-to-upload .ipynb and a .txt AI conversation log for you.
[AI shared download links to Week10_WORKSHEET_Steps1-3.ipynb and AI_conversation_week10.txt and summarized what’s inside.]

User: Can you help me TO Understand and explain each problem clearly?

AI: Absolutely—let’s make Step 1 (“explain in my own words”) crystal clear and student-friendly.
